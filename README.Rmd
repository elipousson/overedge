# overedge

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of overedge is to provide useful functions for making maps with R. This is a collection of miscellaneous functions primarily for working with ggplot2 and sf.

## Installation

You can install the development version of overedge like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("elipousson/overedge")
```

## Example

`overedge` currently provides a single function (`geom_sf_icon`) that wraps `ggsvg::geom_point_svg()` to provide an convenient way to make icon maps:

```{r geom_sf_icon}
library(overedge)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)

nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))
ggplot() +
  geom_sf_icon(data = nc, icon = "point-start", size = 8) +
  theme_void()
```
