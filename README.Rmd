<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of overedge is to provide useful functions for making maps with R. This is a collection of miscellaneous functions primarily for working with ggplot2 and sf.

## Update (2022 July 25)

I'm in the process of migrating all functions from overedge into three more focused packages:

-   [sfext](https://github.com/elipousson/sfext/): sf utilities and read/write functions
-   [getdata](https://github.com/elipousson/getdata/): data access and formatting functions
-   [maplayer](https://github.com/elipousson/maplayer/): ggplot2 mapping and theme functions

None of these packages depend on overedge. getdata depends on sfext and maplayer depends on both getdata and sfext. I expect overedge to develop into a "tidyverse" style package that loads all three packages at once but I will continue to maintain the packages separately for ease of testing and maintenance. In the interim, I do not recommend using overedge.

## Installation

You can install the development version of overedge like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("elipousson/overedge")
```

## Examples

`overedge` currently provides a variety of functions for accessing spatial data, modifying simple feature or bounding box objects, and creating or formatting maps with ggplot2.

### Make icon maps with sf objects and ggplot2

`layer_icon` wraps `ggsvg::geom_point_svg()` to provide an convenient way to make icon maps.

You can create maps using a single named icon that matches one of the icons in `map_icons`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(overedge)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)

nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
nc <- st_transform(nc, 3857)
theme_set(theme_void())

nc_map <-
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nc)

nc_map +
  layer_icon(data = nc, icon = "point-start", size = 8)
```

You can also use an `icon` column from the provided sf object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nc$icon <- rep(c("1", "2", "3", "4"), nrow(nc) / 4)

nc_map +
  layer_icon(data = nc, size = 5)
```

Check `map_icons` to see all supported icon names.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
head(map_icons)
```

### Scale and rotate sf objects

`st_scale_rotate()` is a convenience function for apply affine transformations to sf objects.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nc_rotated <- st_scale_rotate(nc, scale = 0.5, rotate = 15)

nc_map +
  geom_sf(data = nc_rotated, fill = NA, color = "red")
```

### Create inscribed squares in sf objects

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nc_squares <- st_square(nc, inscribed = TRUE)

nc_map +
  geom_sf(data = nc_squares, fill = NA, color = "red")
```

### Add a neatline to a map

`layer_neatline()` hides major grid lines and axis label by default. The function is useful to draw a neatline around a map at a set aspect ratio.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nc_map +
  layer_neatline(
    data = nc,
    asp = "6:4",
    color = "gray60", size = 2, linetype = "dashed"
  )
```

`layer_neatline()` can also be used to focus on a specific area of a map with the option to apply a buffer as a distance or ratio of the diagonal distance for the input data. The `label_axes` and `hide_grid` parameters will not override a set ggplot theme.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_minimal())

nc_map +
  layer_neatline(
    data = nc[1, ],
    diag_ratio = 0.5,
    asp = 1,
    color = "black",
    label_axes = "--EN",
    hide_grid = FALSE
  )
```
